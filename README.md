# Crossmint Coding Megaverse Challenge Solution

## Introduction

In this coding challenge, the task was to create a program that interacts with an API to mint a new "megaverse." A megaverse consists of different astral objects such as POLYanets, SOLoons, and comETHs. The goal was to create a megaverse using a given set of parameters and shapes.

## Solution Overview

The solution is implemented in TypeScript and utilizes a design pattern based on services and a Unit of Work (UoW) to interact with the API. The main flow of the program involves creating astral objects, validating them, and assembling them into the megaverse.

## Solution Components

### 1. Initialization

The program begins by initializing an event emitter and starting the process to create the megaverse.

### 2. Handling Goal Map

The `handleGoalMap` function retrieves the goal map and current map from the API. It then determines which astral objects are missing from the goal map and creates them.

### 3. Astral Unit of Work (AstralUoW)

The `AstralUoW` class manages the creation and deletion of astral objects. It interacts with various services such as `ComethService`, `PolyanetService`, `SoloonService`, and `GoalMapService` to perform API requests.

## Code Snippets

```typescript
// Initialization
(async function init() {
  const event: EventEmitter = new EventEmitter();
  let finishedCounter: number = 0;

  // Checking after running first the handle goalMap creator
  if (finishedCounter > 0) await handleChallengeValidation(event, init);

  // Starting here
  await handleGoalMap(event, init, finishedCounter);
})();

// Handling Goal Map
export async function handleGoalMap(
  event: EventEmitter,
  resetFunction: Function,
  finishedCounter: number
) {
  const astralUoW = new AstralUoW();
  // API interactions and astral creation
}

// Astral Unit of Work (AstralUoW)
class AstralUoW {
  // Methods to interact with services and create astral objects
}
```

## Conclusion

The solution effectively automates the process of creating a megaverse by interacting with the provided API. It demonstrates the use of TypeScript, design patterns, and proper abstraction to model the problem and achieve the desired outcome.
